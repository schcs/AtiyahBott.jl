"""
**AtiyahBott** is a module containing an implementation of the Atiyah-Bott residue formula in the Julia language.
The theory and the algorithm behind the package is described in the paper 
"Effective computations of the Atiyah-Bott formula" by Giosu√® Muratore and 
Csaba Schneider (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11183.pdf).

The colorations (useful to speed up the code) are up to projective spaces of dimension 29.
The full list is here: https://github.com/mgemath/Colorations/.
